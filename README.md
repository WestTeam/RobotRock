Build for x86 in order to simulate strategy.
You need to build HumanAfterAll for your target and cp output in libs folder.
You need to build RPLidar for your target and cp output in libs folder.

Then it's good. Handle with a specific define for SIMU or HW platform is not yet
present so it probably not run on x86 machine for now.
